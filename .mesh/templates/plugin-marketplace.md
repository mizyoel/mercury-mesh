# Plugin Marketplace

Plugins are curated agent templates, skills, instructions, and prompts shared by the community via GitHub repositories (e.g., `github/awesome-copilot`, `anthropics/skills`). They provide ready-made expertise for common domains — cloud platforms, frameworks, testing strategies, etc.

## Marketplace State

Registered marketplace sources are stored in `.mesh/plugins/marketplaces.json`:

```json
{
  "marketplaces": [
    {
      "name": "awesome-copilot",
      "source": "github/awesome-copilot",
      "added_at": "2026-02-14T00:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Registry Management

This package does not currently ship dedicated `mercury-mesh plugin marketplace` commands.

Manage `.mesh/plugins/marketplaces.json` directly or via repo-specific automation. Each entry should include a stable `name`, a `source` repository reference, and an `added_at` timestamp.

## When to Browse

During the **Adding Team Members** flow, AFTER allocating a name but BEFORE generating the charter:

1. Read `.mesh/plugins/marketplaces.json`. If the file doesn't exist or `marketplaces` is empty, skip silently.
2. For each registered marketplace, browse the source repository directly and search for plugins whose name or description matches the new member's role or domain keywords.
3. Present matching plugins to the user: *"Found '{plugin-name}' in {marketplace} marketplace — want me to install it as a skill for {CastName}?"*
4. If the user accepts, install the plugin (see below). If they decline or skip, proceed without it.

## How to Install a Plugin

1. Read the plugin content from the marketplace repository (the plugin's `SKILL.md` or equivalent).
2. Copy it into the agent's skills directory: `.mesh/skills/{plugin-name}/SKILL.md`
3. If the plugin includes charter-level instructions (role boundaries, tool preferences), merge those into the agent's `charter.md`.
4. Log the installation in the agent's `history.md`: *"📦 Plugin '{plugin-name}' installed from {marketplace}."*

## Graceful Degradation

- **No marketplaces configured:** Skip the marketplace check entirely. No warning, no prompt.
- **Marketplace unreachable:** Warn the user (*"⚠ Couldn't reach {marketplace} — continuing without it"*) and proceed with team member creation normally.
- **No matching plugins:** Inform the user (*"No matching plugins found in configured marketplaces"*) and proceed.
